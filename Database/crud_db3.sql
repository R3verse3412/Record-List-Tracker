It was released in June 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. In July 2015, the game was re-released alongside its sequel as the Prototype Biohazard Bundle for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Separate versions of the two games became available in August 2015.[1] In Prototype, players control an amnesiac shapeshifter named Alex Mercer as he attempts to stop an outbreak of a virus called Blacklight in Manhattan, which mutates individuals into powerful, violent monsters. Alex also attempts to uncover his mysterious past while coming into conflict with both the US military and a black operations force called Blackwatch. Outside of the main story, players can freely explore the game\'s open world and engage in several different side activities.\r\n\r\nThe game was well received by critics following its release, gaining praise for its originality, storytelling, and engaging gameplay, while being criticized for its control scheme and scenery. Several reviewers compared and contrasted it with Infamous, a game released about a month prior which had many elements similar to Prototype. It was also a commercial success, selling 2.1 million copies by March 2012. A tie-in comic book miniseries, which serves as a prequel to the events of the game, was published by DC Comics.

In July 2015, the game was re-released alongside its predecessor as the Prototype Biohazard Bundle for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[4] Separate versions of the two games became available in August 2015.[4] Prototype 2 shifts the focus towards a new protagonist, former U.S. Marine Sergeant James Heller, who seeks revenge on Alex Mercer, the protagonist of the original Prototype, after the death of his family during a new outbreak of the Blacklight virus in Manhattan, which was started by Mercer. Heller is infected with a strain of the virus that allows him to keep his humanity while granting him powers similar to Mercer\'s, including shapeshifting and consuming people, which he uses in his mission to stop Mercer and the Blacklight outbreak.\r\n\r\nUpon release, Prototype 2 received generally positive reviews for the PlayStation 3 and Windows versions, and mixed reviews for the Xbox 360 version. Most critics praised it for its entertaining gameplay and improvements over its predecessor in certain areas, although the game\'s repetitive nature and the main storyline attracted criticism.

The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release in November 2012. A remastered version of the game was released in 2019 for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, and in 2021 for Google Stadia.\r\n\r\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, using a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The main narrative is set in 18th-century Colonial America from 1754 to 1783, and follows two characters whose stories are interconnected: Haytham Kenway, a British Templar who attempts to build a presence for his Order in the colonies during the French and Indian War; and Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor, Haytham\'s half-Mohawk son, who becomes an Assassin to protect his people\'s lands and avenge his mother\'s death, and battles the Templars\' attempts to influence the outcome of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nAssassin\'s Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using each playable character\'s combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team-based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, AnvilNext, for the game.[6] Assassin\'s Creed III was one of the first major video game releases to prominently feature Mohawk people (Mohawk: Kanienʼkehá꞉ka[7]), an Iroquoian-speaking Indigenous people of North America. The team sought to capture Mohawk culture as authentically as possible and consulted with cultural experts about the depiction of Connor and other Mohawk characters.

It was a commercial success, selling more than 12 million copies worldwide. Assassin\'s Creed III was released alongside a spin-off for the PlayStation Vita titled Assassin\'s Creed III: Liberation. A sequel, Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag, was released in October 2013. While its modern-day narrative continues from the events of Assassin\'s Creed III, the main plot is set during the Golden Age of Piracy in the early 18th century and follows Haytham\'s father and Connor\'s grandfather, Edward Kenway.

Black Flag was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in October 2013 and a month later for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was later ported to the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Assassin\'s Creed Rogue in December 2019. The game was released for Google Stadia in September 2021.\r\n\r\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who is manipulated into uncovering secrets related to the Assassin-Templar conflict and the precursor race known as the First Civilization. The main story is set in the West Indies during the Golden Age of Piracy from 1715 to 1722, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather of Assassin\'s Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor and father of antagonist Haytham Kenway, as he searches for fortune and a mythical location called the Observatory, which is sought by both the Assassins and the Templars. A major plot element concerns the attempted establishment of an independent Pirate republic in the Caribbean.\r\n\r\nUnlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series\' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game\'s setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin\'s Creed game, where Edward captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet in an early game mission. A number of downloadable content (DLC) packs were released to support Black Flag, including Assassin\'s Creed Freedom Cry, a story expansion that was later made available as a standalone game in 2014. Set over a decade after Black Flag\'s main campaign, Freedom Cry follows Adéwalé, Edward\'s former quartermaster who became an Assassin.\r\n\r\nAssassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag received critical acclaim and became one of the best-selling games of 2013, with over 11 million copies sold as of 2014. Critics praised the open world gameplay, improved naval combat, side-quests, graphics, narrative, characters, and pirate theme. However, the modern-day story and combat received a slightly more mixed response, while criticism fell on aspects of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. The game received several awards and nominations, including winning the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best Action Adventure Game.

It also has ties to Assassin\'s Creed Unity, which was released on the same day as Rogue. It is the last Assassin\'s Creed game to be developed for the seventh generation of consoles, being released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2014[1][2] and for Windows in March 2015.[3][4] A remastered version of the game was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2018.[5] It was also released on the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Black Flag in December 2019[6] and for Google Stadia in October 2021.[7]\r\n\r\nThe plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events in the North-Atlantic and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassin Brotherhood, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templar Order, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set during the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who uncovers various secrets about the Assassin-Templar conflict while attempting to fix the company\'s servers. The main plot is set before and during the French and Indian War from 1752 to 1760, and follows Shay Patrick Cormac, an Irish American privateer and Assassin, who defects to the Templars and helps them hunt down members of his former Brotherhood after becoming disillusioned with their tactics. Gameplay in Rogue is very similar to that of Black Flag with a mixture of ship-based naval exploration and third-person land-based exploration, though some new features have been added.\r\n\r\nUpon release, Rogue received a mixed reception, with praise directed at the game\'s twist on the traditional formula by playing as a Templar, the mature storyline, complex protagonist, and sophisticated depiction of the Assassin-Templar conflict, as well as the additions to the franchise\'s lore and the naval warfare gameplay.

Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini with Paul Crocker and Sefton Hill, Arkham City was inspired by the long-running comic book mythos. In the game\'s main storyline, Batman is incarcerated in Arkham City, a super-prison enclosing the decaying urban slums of fictional Gotham City. He must uncover the secret behind a sinister scheme orchestrated by the facility\'s warden, Dr. Hugo Strange.\r\n\r\nThe game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman\'s combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in both combat and exploration. Batman can freely move around the Arkham City prison, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. Batman\'s ally Catwoman is another playable character, featuring her own story campaign that runs parallel to the game\'s main plot.\r\n\r\nRocksteady conceived ideas for a sequel while developing Arkham Asylum, commencing serious development of Arkham City\'s story in February 2009. The layout of Arkham City has a virtual footprint five times that of Arkham Asylum, and the city design was modified to accommodate Batman\'s ability to swoop and glide.

Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman: Arkham Origins, a direct sequel to Batman: Arkham City (2011) and the fourth main installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Written by Sefton Hill, Ian Ball, and Martin Lancaster, Arkham Knight is inspired by the long-running comic book mythos. Set nine months after the events of Arkham City, the game\'s main storyline follows Batman as he confronts Scarecrow, who has launched an attack on Gotham City and caused a citywide evacuation. Scarecrow, with the help of the mysterious Arkham Knight, plots to unite all of Gotham\'s criminals in an attempt to finally destroy Batman.\r\n\r\nThe game is presented from a third-person perspective, with a primary focus on Batman\'s melee combat, stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets. Batman can freely move around the open world of Gotham City, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage, while stealth allows Batman to conceal himself around an area, using gadgets and the environment to silently eliminate enemies. Arkham Knight introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle, which is used for transportation, puzzle solving and combat.\r\n\r\nDevelopment on Arkham Knight began in 2011 after completion of Arkham City and took place over four years. Rocksteady opted to use its own writers for the main story with collaboration by comic book writer Geoff Johns, choosing to replace Paul Dini who had worked on Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. The introduction of the Batmobile required a change in the team\'s design methodology, as the previous games\' city designs were too narrow and confined to allow smooth travel for the vehicle.\r\n\r\nArkham Knight was released worldwide on June 23, 2015, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. The console versions of the game received generally favorable reviews, and was considered to be a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.

At release, the game was the fastest-selling game of 2015, and the fastest-selling game in the Arkham series, reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015. It was also the 6th best-selling game of 2015 in UK. A Nintendo Switch version was released in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe game also received several accolades, including Best British Game, Best Game, and Best Action-Adventure Game.
